<h2>
<a id="the-big-idea" class="anchor" href="#the-big-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Big Idea</h2>

<hr>

<p>To create a schedule planner for Olin students to configure their timetable  </p>

<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The minimum viable product is to allow Olin students to plan whichever classes they are planning to enrol in/ already enrolled into a calendar in the website that we have created. They will be able to check if the classes clashes with another class and easily plan for possible timetables for course registration.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stretch Goal</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To export data as ical/google calendar, and calendar as JPEG.PDF file.<br>
</li>
<li>To convert into a webpage which can fit into the resolution of any smartphone nicely.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="learning-goals" class="anchor" href="#learning-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning Goals</h2>

<hr>

<p><strong>Shared Goal</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We would like to become better in pair programming as we think it will be beneficial to us in the future. </li>
<li>We would also like to learn how to do web programming.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Individual Goal</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>We feel that one of the main individual learning goal should be to learn how to program from one another.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="implementation-plan" class="anchor" href="#implementation-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation Plan</h2>

<p>We will be using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python.<br>
Library we will be using: jQuery &amp; Flask<br>
We plan to extract course information from Olin, Babson and Wellesley college websites and convert them into data format which can be eaily translated onto calendar.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="project-schedule" class="anchor" href="#project-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Schedule</h2>

<p>Week 1</p>

<ul>
<li>Extract classes information online from Olin, Babson and Wellesley college</li>
</ul>

<p>Week 2</p>

<ul>
<li>Import and format the information that we have extracted into Python</li>
<li>Read and study about all the libraries we are using and try out different possible way of drawing</li>
<li>Get used to web programming</li>
</ul>

<p>Week 3</p>

<ul>
<li>Create UML diagram and divide parts</li>
<li>Create the class needed for drawing the background of the calendar</li>
<li>Create the class that stores all the information of the classes available in Olin</li>
<li>Generate code for interactive programming </li>
</ul>

<p>Week 4</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue the task from week 3</li>
<li>Start integrating the codes</li>
<li>Test out several different scenarios of overlapping schedules/exams</li>
<li>Create a portal/comment box for past students to add their review about courses</li>
</ul>

<p>Week 5</p>

<ul>
<li>Testing of program/website</li>
<li>Look for improvements or beautifying layout of program/website</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="collaboration-plan" class="anchor" href="#collaboration-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collaboration Plan</h2>

<ul>
<li>We plan to split different tasks at the beginning of the project so that acquiring information and learning process can be much faster. </li>
<li>Pair programming will be done throughout the whole program so that every member will be keeping up at the same level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="risks" class="anchor" href="#risks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Risks</h2>

<p>We have to learn web programming all on our own and look for graphical libraries</p>

<p><strong>Shaun</strong></p>

<p>I thought that the technical review was something very special and helpful. As an exchange student, it is my first time experiencing a presentation which is extremely open to the floor. We know that we will be creating this website for Olin students, and therefore it is best that we get feedbacks from current students. This technical review allow our group to explore more useful options of features that we did not thought of at first. </p>

<p>In addition to that, some comments and feedback we got helped us to take a step back and conclude the project once again. Some of our goals in the project is slightly stretched, so one of the student advised us on a backup plan if we do not have sufficient time to complete it on time.</p>

<p>Lastly, this technical review also helped us conclude the research results that we have got to get our project up and running. As different groups have different coding platforms and libraries to serve different purpose, so every group can benefit from the different types of options. </p>

<p><strong>June</strong></p>

<p><em>Feedback and decisions</em></p>

<p>Before the technical review, our main concern was whether we will make an web app or just make an application which runs with python. At first time, we want to make an web app since it would be accessible from any environment. But the problem was that nobody experienced web programming before. So, we had to learn so many stuffs such as JavaScript, SQL, PHP. So we were not sure about whether we can finish our project on time and we wanted some advice about it.</p>

<p>During this technical review, we’ve got some feedbacks about our main concern. Some of audiences told us that 6 weeks are not enough to learn how to do web programming and to make an web app. Other audience said it would be fine even if we just make an app running in python. So we changed our plan to make an application running in python not an web app.</p>

<p>Also, we’ve got lots of feedback about our design especially about the feature of our program. We didn’t expect feedback about our design because two of our group are exchange students and we have it in our home university. So we were used to use existing program and that is why we thought we almost finished about which features we would be included in our program. However, what the student in Olin need was quite different from what we expected. Because the students in Olin haven’t used this kind of program, very new ideas were came out from their feedback. </p>

<p>Their requests are as follow.
Color coded course(e.g. depend on major)
Pre-requisite classes
Want to know which courses are normally taken in certain year and semester.
Want to know how many credits you have taken and how much more left for graduation.
So we are going to consider these ideas and decide our final design.</p>

<p><em>Review Process reflection</em></p>

<p>We didn’t know the technical review would be held like an open discussion, so we just prepare the presentation about what we are going to do. Even though we didn’t prepare much about the technical review, we’ve got so much helpful feedback about our design. The reason why we’ve got helpful feedback is that we introduced our idea effectively. In the presentation, we described our program with a graphical example so everyone easily understood what we are going to make.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in Feedback and decisions, our main concern was whether we make an web app or an app running in Python. But we didn’t know much about web programming, therefore we wanted to get some advices about it. Even though the most of audience also didn’t know about web programming, this technical review was still helpful. That’s because our main concern was not a kind of question that should be talked with many people but could be answered by an expert. After the technical review, we changed our plan to make an app running in Python.</p>

<p>Next time, we could be prepared for discussion and specify what we want to talk with. Also we could provide our process with some graphical resources.</p>

<p><strong>Jee Hyun</strong></p>

<p><em>Feedback &amp; Decisions</em></p>

<p>From the feedbacks we have gotten, we’ve decided to change some of the decisions we have made prior to the technical review session. </p>

<p>The new decisions we have arrived at are:
1. To make a python application instead of a website
2. Concentrate more on the back end
3. Include pre/co requisite requirements
4. Deal with static data we have already pulled and saved 
5. Re look into features we would like to include/exclude</p>

<p><em>Review Process Reflection</em></p>

<p>The review group gave us great insights to our project and their responses motivated us.</p>

<p>Having a design of the website we were going to make helped in explaining the features and the uses. As the review group was the target users themselves, the feedback they gave us reflected what they really want (what features we should have) from the website. Also, they’ve pointed out that we might not have enough time to complete our proposed plan and should focus on the useful parts of the program.</p>

<p>We still have to look into the backend part of the project. All the the groups in our review group came with questions concerning the backend and no one could really answer. </p>

<p>To have a more effective technical review, we can have a UML diagram to explain our code.</p>
