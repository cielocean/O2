{"name":"O2","tagline":"Olin Organizer O2: Timetable Planner for Olin Students","body":"###Project Description\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nOlin Organizer (O2) is a timetable builder and course registration planner for Olin College students. It uses python and tkinter library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Big Idea\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTo create a schedule planner for Olin students to configure their timetable  \r\n\r\n**Minimum Viable Product**\r\n* The minimum viable product is to allow Olin students to plan whichever classes they are planning to enrol in/ already enrolled into a calendar in the website that we have created. They will be able to check if the classes clashes with another class and easily plan for possible timetables for course registration.  \r\n\r\n**Stretch Goal**\r\n* To export data as ical/google calendar, and calendar as JPEG.PDF file.     \r\n* To convert into a webpage which can fit into the resolution of any smartphone nicely.     \r\n\r\n\r\n##Learning Goals  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Shared Goal**\r\n* We would like to become better in pair programming as we think it will be beneficial to us in the future. \r\n* We would also like to learn how to do web programming.  \r\n\r\n**Individual Goal**  \r\n* We feel that one of the main individual learning goal should be to learn how to program from one another.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation Plan  \r\nWe will be using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python.  \r\nLibrary we will be using: jQuery & Flask  \r\nWe plan to extract course information from Olin, Babson and Wellesley college websites and convert them into data format which can be eaily translated onto calendar.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Project Schedule\r\nWeek 1\r\n* Extract classes information online from Olin, Babson and Wellesley college\r\n\r\nWeek 2\r\n* Import and format the information that we have extracted into Python\r\n* Read and study about all the libraries we are using and try out different possible way of drawing\r\n* Get used to web programming\r\n\r\nWeek 3\r\n* Create UML diagram and divide parts\r\n* Create the class needed for drawing the background of the calendar\r\n* Create the class that stores all the information of the classes available in Olin\r\n* Generate code for interactive programming \r\n\r\nWeek 4\r\n* Continue the task from week 3\r\n* Start integrating the codes\r\n* Test out several different scenarios of overlapping schedules/exams\r\n* Create a portal/comment box for past students to add their review about courses\r\n\r\nWeek 5\r\n* Testing of program/website\r\n* Look for improvements or beautifying layout of program/website\r\n\r\n##Collaboration Plan\r\n* We plan to split different tasks at the beginning of the project so that acquiring information and learning process can be much faster. \r\n* Pair programming will be done throughout the whole program so that every member will be keeping up at the same level.\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\nWe have to learn web programming all on our own and look for graphical libraries\r\n\r\n### Design Review\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Preparation and Framing\r\n\r\nWe hope that other groups gets to know about what our project is about. Therefore, we plan to start the review by giving an overview on Olin Organizer. In addition, it would be easy for the audience to participate because this project could be a potential program in Olin. We want to find out what functions does students want from Olin organizer. There are too many functions that we can implement in a program so we need feedback to sieve out those that many will prefer. We will provide a agenda for the design review so our audience will know the flow of presentation. We also plan to get audience involved by allocating a time for them to give their comments.\r\n\r\nPresentation Flow\r\n\r\n1. Overview of our project: Project Description\r\n2. Agenda of presentation\r\n3. First draft of our product GUI\r\n4. Features\r\n - Explain features we are planning on implementing\r\n - Explain how the features interact with one another\r\n - Get feedback on the features they would like to see/ they do not require\r\n5. Libraries\r\n - Libraries we are intending to use\r\n - Feedback on additional libraries we could look into/ on the libraries we are going to use\r\n6. Timeline: Steps we are planning to take\r\n7. Open feedback session\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reflection and Synthesis\r\n\r\n\r\n**Shaun**\r\n\r\nI thought that the technical review was something very special and helpful. As an exchange student, it is my first time experiencing a presentation which is extremely open to the floor. We know that we will be creating this website for Olin students, and therefore it is best that we get feedbacks from current students. This technical review allow our group to explore more useful options of features that we did not thought of at first. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, some comments and feedback we got helped us to take a step back and conclude the project once again. Some of our goals in the project is slightly stretched, so one of the student advised us on a backup plan if we do not have sufficient time to complete it on time.\r\n\r\nLastly, this technical review also helped us conclude the research results that we have got to get our project up and running. As different groups have different coding platforms and libraries to serve different purpose, so every group can benefit from the different types of options. \r\n\r\n\r\n**June**\r\n\r\n_Feedback and decisions_\r\n\r\nBefore the technical review, our main concern was whether we will make an web app or just make an application which runs with python. At first time, we want to make an web app since it would be accessible from any environment. But the problem was that nobody experienced web programming before. So, we had to learn so many stuffs such as JavaScript, SQL, PHP. So we were not sure about whether we can finish our project on time and we wanted some advice about it.\r\n\r\nDuring this technical review, we’ve got some feedbacks about our main concern. Some of audiences told us that 6 weeks are not enough to learn how to do web programming and to make an web app. Other audience said it would be fine even if we just make an app running in python. So we changed our plan to make an application running in python not an web app.\r\n\r\nAlso, we’ve got lots of feedback about our design especially about the feature of our program. We didn’t expect feedback about our design because two of our group are exchange students and we have it in our home university. So we were used to use existing program and that is why we thought we almost finished about which features we would be included in our program. However, what the student in Olin need was quite different from what we expected. Because the students in Olin haven’t used this kind of program, very new ideas were came out from their feedback. \r\n\r\nTheir requests are as follow.\r\nColor coded course(e.g. depend on major)\r\nPre-requisite classes\r\nWant to know which courses are normally taken in certain year and semester.\r\nWant to know how many credits you have taken and how much more left for graduation.\r\nSo we are going to consider these ideas and decide our final design.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Review Process reflection_\r\n\r\nWe didn’t know the technical review would be held like an open discussion, so we just prepare the presentation about what we are going to do. Even though we didn’t prepare much about the technical review, we’ve got so much helpful feedback about our design. The reason why we’ve got helpful feedback is that we introduced our idea effectively. In the presentation, we described our program with a graphical example so everyone easily understood what we are going to make.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in Feedback and decisions, our main concern was whether we make an web app or an app running in Python. But we didn’t know much about web programming, therefore we wanted to get some advices about it. Even though the most of audience also didn’t know about web programming, this technical review was still helpful. That’s because our main concern was not a kind of question that should be talked with many people but could be answered by an expert. After the technical review, we changed our plan to make an app running in Python.\r\n\r\nNext time, we could be prepared for discussion and specify what we want to talk with. Also we could provide our process with some graphical resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Jee Hyun**\r\n\r\n_Feedback & Decisions_\r\n\r\nFrom the feedback we have gotten, we’ve decided to change some of the decisions we have made prior to the technical review session. \r\n\r\nThe new decisions are:\r\n\r\n1. To make a python application instead of a website\r\n2. Concentrate more on the back end\r\n3. Include pre/co requisite requirements\r\n4. Deal with static data we have already pulled and saved \r\n5. Re look into features we would like to include/exclude\r\n\r\n\r\n_Review Process Reflection_\r\n\r\nThe review group gave us great insights to our project and their responses motivated us.\r\n\r\nHaving a design of the website we were going to make helped in explaining the features and making the other groups be on the same page as us. As the review group was the target users themselves, the feedback they gave us reflected what they would really want to see (what features we should have) from the website. Also, they’ve pointed out that we might not have enough time to complete our proposed plan and should focus on the useful parts of the program.\r\n\r\nWe still have to look into the backend part of the project. All the the groups in our review group came with questions concerning the backend and no one could really answer. \r\n\r\nTo have a more effective technical review, we can have a UML diagram to explain our code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Review\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Preparation and Framing\r\n\r\nWe plan to tell the audience that we are changing from website to program and we are using Model­View­Controller (MVC) coding structure. We are also going to explain how Model, View and Controller classes implemented in our code and how they interact with one another. There are several structure that a group can use in order to implement a function. As we are using MVC structure, we want to get feedback from the audience as well as Professor Benjamin. It could be a piece of advice on using MVC structure or giving us another option that could be better.\r\n\r\nWe will present our review as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Explain parts of our code – This will help audience understand how the program flows, we will also provide some graphical resources such as a prototype of GUI\r\n2. Give a brief description of code structure – We will explain some classes which are related to our key questions\r\n3. Release the key questions – Ensure the audience understands the reason of the key question as we will describe our current situation\r\n4. Receive feedback from audience – We will flash our code and ask for comments from the audience.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n1. How can two (or more) different classes interact with one another - can inheritance work both ways?\r\n2. Is there a more effective way of implementing course search?\r\n3. Which widgets we should use from tkinter library?\r\n\r\n#### Reflection and Synthesis\r\n\r\n\r\n**Shaun**\r\n\r\nWe feel that the code review is tougher to manage compared to design review because different groups are working on different libraries and functions in Python. We thought that it will be better if there is an actual code review (could be presented by Ninja or Professors) in class. In addition, different groups in a review section should send information about some libraries that they are using to other groups. This is to see if there is any coincidence between 2 groups who might be using the same type of library like Tkinter. However, one group should not overload other groups on information about the libraries that they are using because other groups might not have sufficient time to read on all the sources.\r\n\r\nI think that the code review helped our group to certain extend. We were worried about different classes communicating together at the same time with interaction with the user. We got some feedback from other groups about some methods that can be used to resolve the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n**June**\r\n\r\nOur first question was about how we should implement the search function in CourseList(). Before the code review, we planned to implement the search course function by looking through the entire course list to find the courses that matched given conditions. During the code review, most of audience agreed with our suggestion and hence, we decided to go on with this decision.\r\n\r\nOur second question was about how two classes might interact both ways. In the previous project, some of us implement the interaction between two classes by setting one class as an attribute of the other class and access the class by calling its attribute. However, this method is only possible for one-way interaction. Since we have two classes that needs to have interaction with each other in parallel, we needed to find a new way to implement this. Fortunately, Prof. Ben gave a great suggestion about this problem. His suggestion was implementing interaction in another class that can access both classes. So we decided to follow his suggestion.\r\n\r\nAt first, we thought code review was a platform we could discuss our ways to implement code. Therefore, we wanted to discuss how we can implement some functions in our code such as searching method and handling interaction between classes. However, we didn’t provide enough context to the audience to be able to understand our code and our code had not been implemented much. As a result, we didn’t have enough question to ask and failed to make audience to be in the same page with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Jee Hyun**\r\n\r\nIn general, the code review felt like a second design review. Some groups have gotten pretty far with coding. However, the review session was spent mostly on getting feedback on the design, function and layout we wanted to see more than how the code was being implemented currently and what were possible improvements that could be made to make it more efficient or professional. This might be due to the fact that going through the code is not an effective or engaging presentation method and the knowledge each group picks up doing our own project is not the same. Pre readings with questions and some background context of the questions might have led to a more useful code review session where we could discuss possible implementation plan in class. Also, UML diagram would have helped greatly when discussing the code. \r\n\r\nLearning points from the code review:\r\n\r\n1. Frame the problems we want to ask and breakdown into simple questions\r\n\r\n2. If the question needs background context, make sure to prepare a pre reading so that we can have constructive discussion in class\r\n\r\n3. Have a UML diagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A collaboration by KAIST, NUS & Olin","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
