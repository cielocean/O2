{"name":"O2","tagline":"Olin Organizer O2: Timetable Planner for Olin Students","body":"### A collaboration by KAIST, NUS &Olin\r\n\r\n##The Big Idea\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTo create a schedule planner for Olin students to configure their timetable  \r\n\r\n**Minimum Viable Product**\r\n* The minimum viable product is to allow Olin students to plan whichever classes they are planning to enrol in/ already enrolled into a calendar in the website that we have created. They will be able to check if the classes clashes with another class and easily plan for possible timetables for course registration.  \r\n\r\n**Stretch Goal**\r\n* To export data as ical/google calendar, and calendar as JPEG.PDF file.     \r\n* To convert into a webpage which can fit into the resolution of any smartphone nicely.     \r\n\r\n\r\n##Learning Goals  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Shared Goal**\r\n* We would like to become better in pair programming as we think it will be beneficial to us in the future. \r\n* We would also like to learn how to do web programming.  \r\n\r\n**Individual Goal**  \r\n* We feel that one of the main individual learning goal should be to learn how to program from one another.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Implementation Plan  \r\nWe will be using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python.  \r\nLibrary we will be using: jQuery & Flask  \r\nWe plan to extract course information from Olin, Babson and Wellesley college websites and convert them into data format which can be eaily translated onto calendar.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Project Schedule\r\nWeek 1\r\n* Extract classes information online from Olin, Babson and Wellesley college\r\n\r\nWeek 2\r\n* Import and format the information that we have extracted into Python\r\n* Read and study about all the libraries we are using and try out different possible way of drawing\r\n* Get used to web programming\r\n\r\nWeek 3\r\n* Create UML diagram and divide parts\r\n* Create the class needed for drawing the background of the calendar\r\n* Create the class that stores all the information of the classes available in Olin\r\n* Generate code for interactive programming \r\n\r\nWeek 4\r\n* Continue the task from week 3\r\n* Start integrating the codes\r\n* Test out several different scenarios of overlapping schedules/exams\r\n* Create a portal/comment box for past students to add their review about courses\r\n\r\nWeek 5\r\n* Testing of program/website\r\n* Look for improvements or beautifying layout of program/website\r\n\r\n##Collaboration Plan\r\n* We plan to split different tasks at the beginning of the project so that acquiring information and learning process can be much faster. \r\n* Pair programming will be done throughout the whole program so that every member will be keeping up at the same level.\r\n\r\n##Risks\r\nWe have to learn web programming all on our own and look for graphical libraries\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
